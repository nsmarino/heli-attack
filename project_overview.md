This is a game called "Galatea", which consists of two main gameplay phases:

- In the WORKSHOP phase, the player customizes an avatar, selecting from various parts for the head, torso, and lower body.

- In the WALK_CYCLE phase, the avatar walks through a surreal landscape as their health, represented by a bar at the top of the screen, slowly decreases. Floating particles drift toward the avatar and, when clicked, restore health.
